<h3 class="section-heading">In Barcelona, there is no Santa Claus...</h3>

<p>Santa Claus doesn't visit Catalonia.  Instead, every household has a log, which children beat with sticks while chanting until the log "shits" presents.</p>

<p>This is not a joke.</p>

<p>Don't believe us?  Check out this <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti%C3%B3_de_Nadal'>Wikipedia entry about it</a>, or google "caga tió" (which translates, literally, as "poop log"), or just watch the below video:</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">The song</h3>


<p>While literally beating the shit out of a log, children are expected to sing the traditional "caga tió" song.  The lyrics are worth translating in full:</p>


<center>
<br>Shit, log!
<br>Log of Christmas,
<br>don't shit herrings,
<br>they are too salty,
<br>shit nougats
<br>for they are better!
</center>

<p>Again, this isn't a joke.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">But does anybody actually do this?</h3>

<p>Yes.  Everyone in Catalonia. Catalans love the poop log so much that, in addition to celebrating it at home, they also often gather in large groups, with a massive log, beat it relentlessly, and then delight at the site of it shitting many presents:</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">What does this have to do with data?</h3>

<p>We're making a bold prediction.  In 100 years, Santa Claus will be a relic of the past, and people <em>everywhere</em> will be celebrating in this, ahem, unique Catalan fashion.</p>

<p>What's our rationale?  Data, of course.  We've analyzed global interest in variations of Christmas celebrations, and the reality is that the Catalan poop log is attracting more and more interest every year.  Meanwhile, Santa Claus is flatlining.</p>

<p>Ultimately, holidays compete in a Darwinian contest, in which only the superior thrive (which is why you've probably never celebrated <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Catfish_Day'>National Catfish Day</a>). Before now, the poop log was almost a secret, its awesomeness only known to Catalans.  But in today's globalized world, the Catalan tradition of beating the shit out of a log will clearly beat out a creepy obese man sneaking into your home through the chimney.</p>

<p>Nice try, Santa, but your reign is over.  Bring on the poop log!</p>
