<h3 class="section-heading">Some things are best not left to chance</h3>

<p>Finding a significant other can be a significant challenge. But ultimately, like so many other things in life, it's a numbers game - the likelihood of finding Mr(s). Right is dependent on the number of Mr(s). Wrongs you're willing to sift through first.</p>

<p>And right or wrong, if you're looking for humans of a particular gender in Barcelona, you're best off not leaving your search to chance alone. There are neighborhoods where men outnumber women 3 to 2. On the other hand, in the most female-dense neighborhood, there are 70% more women than men.</p>
