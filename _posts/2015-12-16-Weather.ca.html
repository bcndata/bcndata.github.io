<h3 class="section-heading">What exactly is "good" weather?</h3>

<p>Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The temperature is comfortable.</li>
<li>That temperature is predictable (ie, there's not too much variance).</li>
</ol>

<p>By these standards, Barcelona has...</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Granda looks terrible</span>

<p>MÃ¡laga has nice winters but oppresive summers.  Bilbao, in addition to being covered in clouds most of the year, has wildly unpredictable summer temperature swings.  Madrid's summers are too hot and its winters too cold.  And Granada - don't even start.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">No crazy swings</h3>


<p>What's most striking is how little <em>variance</em> there is in Barcelona's daily temperatures. On average, the daily "swing" (difference between maximum and minimum temperature) in Barcelona is only 7.1 degrees (C).  In Madrid, it's 12. This means that in Barcelona, when you get dressed in the morning, your outfit is likely to remain comfortable all day; in Granada (where the daily swing is 14 degrees), no matter what you wear, you'll end up either shivering or sweating.</p>

<p>With an average of 24 in July and 10 in January, it doesn't get much better than Barcelona. Compare that to New York which is hotter in July (25) and <em>way</em> colder in January (0!).</p>
